                    <div>
                        A few of my favorite accomplishments include designing my own reinforcement learning AI with a unique modified decision-making
                        model, creating my own programming language and game engine, designing a unique 3D-printed 2-stage
                        pump to mimic the human heart, being the top graduate from a 3-month software developer training
                        program in Bhubaneswar, India, and receiving exemplary ratings as the teacher of a summer robotics
                        course for kids. <br /><br /> I’m a quick learner with a broad set of skills
                        in both Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science. I enjoy opportunities to creatively solve problems
                        and challenge myself, and I put that energy into my work, taking the initiative to go above and beyond
                        my job duties when I see a way to help. I enjoy teaching and working with children, which has given
                        me strong communication skills. My hobbies include writing music, playing guitar, sports, video games,
                        and designing hardware and software I’ll probably never build.

                                    This was my first big programming project, and remains one of my favorites. Spellthief was designed to make players reverse
                                    engineer a programming language in order to craft their own spells and abilities. I built
                                    my own game engine in C++, and built a custom programming language into the engine. Every
                                    action of every object in the game was performed by executing a line of code in this
                                    language. The programming language, engine, and tools for level creation were fully functional,
                                    and I successfully produced and player-tested several levels.

                                <div>
                                    I built a simple robot to demonstrate a reinforcement learning AI that I created and got it to demonstrate pathfinding capabilities
                                    on limited hardware. I found ways to compensate for a low-resolution color sensor, a
                                    lack of motor encoders, and battery drainage. <br /> <br /> The robot was built under tight budget constraints. and had to demonstrate
                                    its abilities within a time limit, which is especially limiting for a model-free reinforcement
                                    learning model. It performed adequately despite these constraints.

                                    I created a Web API in ASP.net designed for group messaging with as little storage space as possible. The server dynamically
                                    scales its memory usage as users connect and disconnect from the chat, and deletes messages
                                    from the server once every user has received them. I deployed this API to Azure with
                                    CORS enabled in order to consume its services from a mobile app.

                                    I taught myself Xamarin by building a turn-based strategy game. The game used most major features of the Xamarin platorm,
                                    including PCLs, data binding, and a 100% shared codebase for iOS and Android using Xamarin
                                    Forms. I used the app to demonstrate my Xamarin knowledge to a potential client, and
                                    was offered a spot on the project.

                                    Worked on small agile teams on internal and client projects as a web and mobile developer. Wrote a curriculum for an internal
                                    Xamarin training program, after completing the existing Xamarin training program and
                                    proposing changes. I trained in India for 3 months at Mindtree's Kalinga facility beginning
                                    in January 2017, and was the top graduate out of 400+ candidates. Training included a
                                    mix of self-guided learning and internal projects.

                                    Sciences. My duties included collecting customer requirements, designing and building
                                    prototypes, presenting prototypes for approval, and documenting my work for future TAs.

                                    Taught week-long Lego Robotics summer classes to kids ages 6-11, and received excellent ratings from both students and parents.
                                    After observing low student engagement in building the provided designs, I improvised
                                    by creating a more gamified class structure based around iteratively building, testing,
                                    and improving simpler designs. This proved to be a more engaging structure due to its
                                    tighter feedback loop and short term rewards. I presented my curriculum to my supervisor,
                                    and my job duties were expanded to include developing curriculum for the following summer.
